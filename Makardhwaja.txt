According to Ramayana told by Valmiki, this story has no place in it. However, in local folk tales this story is related. When Ahiravana took Rama and Lakshmana to Patala, Hanuman followed them to their rescue.[5] He was challenged at the gate of Patala by a creature, who was part Vanara and part reptile - a Makara. He introduced himself Makaradhwaja and son of Hanuman, the mighty warrior.[1][2]

Hanuman was amused and said that, I am myself the Hanuman but he could not be his son, as he was Brahmachari complete celibate since birth. However, Hanuman then closed his eyes in dhyana to see the events described above of Makardhwaja's birth.[citation needed]

Makardhwaja asked him for his blessings, however, he said to Hanuman, that he will have to fight him to enter Patala, as he cannot betray Ahiravana, his mentor. Hanuman defeats Makaradhwaja in a duel and then ties him to the back to proceed further to ultimately kill Ahiravana and rescue Rama & Lakshamana as Makardhawaja is presented as the exemplary devotee (bhakta) of Ahiravana as Hanuman for Rama.[1][2] While returning from patal lok Shri Ram takes a glance at Makradhwaj in pain, post enquiring Hanuman narrates the story to Shri Ram. Shri Ram being impressed by Makardhwajs stand for his mentor and fight with Hanuman declares him the king of Patal Lok as then king Ahiravan was killed.
